This repository contains a Python project that implements a terminal-based maze solver using the curses library. The program navigates through a predefined maze from a starting point ('O') to a goal ('X') using breadth-first search (BFS). The maze visualization includes colored paths to illustrate the shortest route found. Users can interact with the solver directly in the terminal.![image](https://github.com/shahizmoidin/python-curses-maze/assets/114342600/c822c4e6-2a9f-4158-9e23-cf77520f8c56)
