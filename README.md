<p>This repository contains a Python project that implements a terminal-based maze solver using the curses library. The program navigates through a predefined maze from a starting point ('O') to a goal ('X') using breadth-first search (BFS). The maze visualization includes colored paths to illustrate the shortest route found. Users can interact with the solver directly in the terminal.</p>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<p>Follow these steps to clone the repository and run the terminal maze solver on your local machine:</p>

<pre>
git clone https://github.com/shahizmoidin/python-curses-maze.git
cd python-curses-maze
</pre>

<h3>Prerequisites</h3>

<p>Ensure you have Python installed on your machine. Additionally, if the project has dependencies listed in a <code>requirements.txt</code> file, install them using:</p>

<pre>
pip install -r requirements.txt
</pre>

<h3>Running the Program</h3>

<p>Once the prerequisites are installed, you can run the program using:</p>

<pre>
python main.py
</pre>

<p>Enjoy navigating through the maze directly in your terminal!</p>
